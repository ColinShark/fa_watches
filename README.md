# fa_watches

Get your FA Watches.

## Usage

1. Download the file (or copy-paste it, idc)
2. Put your FA username in the `USERNAME` variable ([line 6](watches.py#L6))
3. Execute it (`python3 watches.py`)
4. You'll get a file with your username containing all the accounts you were watching.

I plan to make it a bit more clean and enable you to auto-watch the accounts from a new account, in case you were switching accounts.
I gotta see about that tho...

## License

None, do as you please. I don't care lol
